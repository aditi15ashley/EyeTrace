# EyeTrace

This is a computer vision python(2 and 3) application that provides a webcam-based eye tracking system. It gives you the exact position of the pupils and the gaze direction in real-time. Using calibration we can use these pupil coordinates to give us the eye-trace of a user's gaze while looking at something on a screen. 

## **Installation:** 

### **Clone this project :**

```
git clone https://github.com/aditi15ashley/EyeTrace.git
```

### **Install these dependencies :**

pip install -r requirement.txt 
```
> The Dlib library has four primary prerequisites: Boost, Boost.Python, CMake and X11/XQuartx. If you doesn't have them, you can read this article to know how to easily install them : https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/

> OpenCV 4 is not supported yet, make sure to install version 3.4

### **Run the demo :**

```
python gaze.py
