# EyeTrace

This is a computer vision python(2 and 3) application that provides a webcam-based eye tracking system. It gives you the exact position of the pupils and the gaze direction in real-time. Using calibration we can use these pupil coordinates to give us the eye-trace of a user's gaze while looking at something on a screen.
